# Graph Maker
Desktop applicaton to manage and visualize graph structures. Made with React + TypeScript + NodeJS + Electron and more.

### Portable version
* [Web App v2.0](https://guilherme8482.github.io/graph-maker/)
* [Windows x86 v2.0](https://github.com/Guilherme8482/GraphMaker/raw/master/dist/graph-maker-2%202.1.0.exe)

### Description
An application developed in the classroom to prove how useful search methods are in graph theory, and this can be seen by creating a map that under the hood contains a graph and provides the best possible way to move from point to another.

### Next steps
* Implement graph algorihms in WebAssembly using a low level language like C++ or Rust to improve performance and reduce the memory usage. Even the best aproach is already in use for typescript language, choose a better language is useful in this cases.
* Change visualization interface. Today is used a HTML canvas that is fast enough to show 2d graphics. But a 3D interface is coolest than a plan map, and using a 3D library like WebGL or ThreeJS is better to show more elements that describe a graph map.
* Add more options when setup a new graph map, like directed, non square maps, multidimensional maps and more(?).
